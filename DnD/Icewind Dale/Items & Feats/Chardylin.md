# Chardylin
The chardalyn amulets worn by the Knights of the Black Sword have been corrupted by the magic of Levistus. A [detect evil and good](https://5e.tools/spells.html#detect%20evil%20and%20good_phb) spell or similar magic reveals that the amulets are desecrated objects.

Each day at dawn, roll a d6 for each chardalyn amulet in a character's possession. On a roll of 1, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become lawful evil, unless the character has that alignment already. Take the character's player aside to describe how the player should roleplay the new alignment. A lawful evil character craves power and tries to exert control over others, by being either cruel or manipulative.

The alignment change can be undone by any magic that ends a curse, but after nine days, it can be reversed only by a [wish](https://5e.tools/spells.html#wish_phb) spell or divine intervention.
